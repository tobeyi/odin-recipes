        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Chicken Legs - 4 to 6</li>
            <li>Olive Oil - 2 tablespoons</li>
            <li>Garlic Powder - 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Paprika - 1 teaspoon</li>
            <li>Salt - ½ teaspoon</li>
            <li>Black Pepper - ¼ teaspoon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the Air Fryer: Set your air fryer to 380°F (193°C) and let it warm up for about 3-5 minutes. This ensures even cooking right from the start.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Chicken: Pat the chicken legs dry with paper towels. This helps the skin get crispy.</li>
            <li>Season: In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Rub this mixture all over the chicken legs, making sure they're well-coated.</li>
            <li>Arrange in Air Fryer: Place the chicken legs in the air fryer basket in a single layer. Make sure they're not touching so the hot air can circulate freely, ensuring even cooking and crispiness.</li>
            <li>Cook: Air fry the chicken legs for about 25-30 minutes. Halfway through the cooking time, flip the legs to ensure they brown and crisp up evenly on all sides.</li>
            <li>Check for Doneness: The chicken is done when it reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C) at the thickest part of the leg, away from the bone. Use a meat thermometer to check.</li>
            <li>Rest and Serve: Let the chicken legs rest for a few minutes after cooking. This allows the juices to redistribute, keeping the meat moist. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
