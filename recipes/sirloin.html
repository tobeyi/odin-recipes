        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Sirloin Steaks - 2 steaks, about 1 inch thick</li>
            <li>Salt - to taste, preferably coarse or kosher for better seasoning</li>
            <li>Black Pepper - freshly ground, to taste</li>
            <li>Olive Oil - 2 tablespoons, for searing</li>
            <li>Butter - 2 tablespoons, for basting and added flavor</li>
            <li>Garlic - 2 cloves, lightly crushed (optional)</li>
            <li>Fresh Rosemary or Thyme - a few sprigs (optional), for aromatic infusion</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Prep the Steak: Take the sirloin steaks out of the refrigerator about 30 minutes before cooking to allow them to come to room temperature. This promotes even cooking.</li>
            <li>Season: Pat the steaks dry with paper towels to ensure a good sear. Season both sides generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat the Pan: Heat a heavy skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and allow it to get hot, but not smoking.</li>
            <li>Sear the Steak: Carefully place the steaks in the hot skillet. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on one side, until a golden-brown crust forms. Then, flip the steaks to sear the other side.</li>
            <li>Add Flavor: After flipping the steaks, add the butter, garlic, and herbs (if using) to the skillet. As the butter melts, tilt the pan slightly and use a spoon to baste the steaks with the melted butter, garlic, and herb mixture. Continue to cook for another 3-4 minutes for medium-rare, or longer depending on your desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Check for Doneness: Use a meat thermometer to ensure your steak is cooked to your liking. For medium-rare, look for an internal temperature of about 135°F (57°C).</li>
            <li>Rest: Remove the steaks from the skillet and let them rest on a cutting board or plate for about 5 minutes before slicing. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, ensuring a moist and flavorful steak.</li>
            <li>Serve: Slice against the grain and serve immediately, perhaps with a side of your choice or a simple salad for a complete meal.</li>
        </ol>
