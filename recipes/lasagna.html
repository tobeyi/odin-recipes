        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Lasagna noodles - 9 to 12 sheets</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheest - 15 ounces</li>
            <li>Large egg</li>
            <li>Shredded mozzarella cheese - 2 cups</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan cheese - half a cup</li>
            <li>Marinara sauce - 24 ounces</li>
            <li>Ground beef - 1 pound</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper - to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh basil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat Oven: Set your oven to 375°F (190°C) to ensure it's ready for baking.</li>
            <li>Cook Pasta: Boil the penne pasta in salted water until it's just al dente, usually about 1 minute less than the package instructions. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Brown Ground Beef: While the pasta cooks, brown the ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Once fully cooked, drain any excess fat.</li>
            <li>Mix Marinara: Stir the marinara sauce into the cooked ground beef, combining them thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Prepare Cheese Mixture: In a bowl, mix the ricotta cheese with the egg, and season with a little salt and pepper. This mixture adds richness and helps bind the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, gently combine the cooked pasta with the beef and marinara sauce mixture. Fold in the ricotta mixture and half of the shredded mozzarella cheese until everything is evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Assemble in Baking Dish: Transfer the mixture to a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and all of the grated Parmesan cheese evenly over the top.</li>
            <li>Bake: Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Then, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese on top is golden and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Rest and Serve: Let the "lazy lasagna" rest for a few minutes after baking. This makes it easier to serve and allows the flavors to meld beautifully.</li>
